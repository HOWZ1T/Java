# Java Projects
![Unimpressed Bitmoji](https://s13.postimg.org/p6f6edrpj/gitimage.png)  
This repo contains a collection of mini java projects which I have attempted for practice purposes. Projects are based on the [Mega Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects/) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Feel free to comment and give me tips, corrections, or suggestion if you feel like it.

## Numbers
**[Change Maker](https://github.com/j-afarian/Java/blob/master/changemaker.java)**  
The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change in Australia denomination coins to return.

**[Even Fibonacci](https://github.com/j-afarian/Java/blob/master/EvenFibonacci.java)**  
Finds the sum of all even fibonacci numbers whose value does not exceed four million.

**[Three & Five](https://github.com/j-afarian/Java/blob/master/ThreeAndFive.java)**  
Finds the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000.

**[Floor Tiles](https://github.com/j-afarian/Java/blob/master/FloorTiles.java)**  
Calculate the cost of floor tiles given the width and height of the floor, and cost of tiles as per user input.

## Text
**[FizzBuzz](https://github.com/j-afarian/Java/blob/master/fizzbuzz.java)**  
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
