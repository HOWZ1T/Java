# Java Projects
![Unimpressed Bitmoji](https://s13.postimg.org/p6f6edrpj/gitimage.png)  
This repo contains a collection of mini java projects which I have attempted for practice purposes. Projects are based on the [Mega Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects/). Feel free to comment and give me tips, corrections, or suggestion if you feel like it.

## Numbers
**[Change Maker](https://github.com/j-afarian/Java/blob/master/changemaker.java)**  
The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change in Australia denomination coins to return.

## Text
**[FizzBuzz](https://github.com/j-afarian/Java/blob/master/fizzbuzz.java)**  
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
